<h2>CNN and RNN</h2>

This is quite a ritual or a beginner project to start with Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs).

I have used <i>MNIST</i> dataset which is the de facto 'Hello World' dataset of computer vision.

I have applied CNN using Keras library and RNN in Tensorflow 1.0 and provided a short note on CNNs and RNNs(Recurrent Neural Networks).

Hope you will get an idea of these architectures by going through my <a href="https://github.com/NightmareNight-em/Handwritten-Digit-Recognition/blob/master/A_short_note_on_CNN%26RNN.docx">note</a>.
