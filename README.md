<h2>CNN and RNN</h2>

This is quite a ritual or a beginner project to start with Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs).

MNIST dataset is the de facto 'Hello World' dataset of computer vision(It's copied xD)

I have applied CNN using Keras library and RNN in tensorflow 1.0 and provided a short note on CNNs and RNNs(Recurrent Neural Networks).

Hope you will get an idea of these architectures by going through my note.
